README for the SPC Historical Probability of Severe Weather data visualization


Abstract:
Three python scripts are contained in this project that display the SPC Historical 
Probabiliy od Severe Weather data onto a map (Albers Equal Area Conic for CONUS region).

Data Provider: NOAA Storm Prediction Center, National Severe Storms Laboratory
Dataset: http://www.spc.noaa.gov/new/SVRclimo/climo.php?parm=anySvr


Python script listing:

SevereDriver.py	- Drives the mapping and colorbar scripts

SevereMap.py	- Creates a map image of the data

SevereColorbar.py	- Creates a corresponding colorbar


Program Usage:

Image production begins by executing SevereDriver.py, which will create a daily image of 
a desired size. The possible image sizes (in pixel width) include 620px, 1000px, 4096px 
(DIY), 1920px (HD, or HDSD). An example call to the driver routine:

“path to python”  SevereDriver.py “day of year” “image size”

e.g., 
/usr/bin/python  SevereDriver.py 140 DIY


Valid “image size” values are:
620 (620px wide image)
1000 (1000px wide image)
DIY (4096px wide image)
HD (1920px wide image in high definition)
HDSD (1920px wide image suitable for either high definition or standard definition

Valid day of year values range from 1 through 366 (includes Feb 29, i.e., leap year)

Software and Dependencies:

The scripts included here were built for Python 2.7. The following
modules must exist on the system for them to perform correctly:

matplotlib-1.1.1 (or higher)
PIL (python imaging library, 1.1.7 or higher, PIL is the Python Imaging Library)
mpl_toolkits.basemap
numpy
sys
os
subprocess
time
matplotlib.font_manager (in order to utilize the true type font MS Trebuchet, which is not
	included as a "base" font in python*)
	*The usage of PIL and the font manager inside matplotlib in these scripts requires
	the ability to utilize true type fonts. As such for example on a linux box, one would
	need to have installed the freetype-dev packages. Specifically, libfreetype6-dev needs
	to be installed on ubuntu... 

Other files in this project:
colorbar and logo (.png and .eps) files included here are sized for each of the image 
sizes and are used by the various python scripts that produce the reprojected images



Notes on portability:

1) All image making scripts in the project need the path to Trebuchet MS true-type font.
e.g.,

	/usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/Trebuchet_MS.ttf

	*This path depends entirely on the location the sysadmin installs “add-on” fonts.
